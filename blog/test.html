<h1 class="title">Animated Posters - 2013 Student Festival</h1>
<h3 class="date">2016-01-22</h3>
</header>
<p>In the 2013 winter term, I was in charge of the poster design of the student festival of our department. The student festival, “砼年不同Young”, and the publicity of the festival have received a lot of attention on campus.</p>
<p>Inspired by famous movies, including V for Revenge, Iron Man, and etc., I designed a list of six animated posters, which have received a lot of views on the Internet. The prototype of these designs is 砼仔 (concrete boy, pronounced [təŋ tsai]).</p>
<p>The six posters are originally posted on <a href="http://page.renren.com/601834083/channel-albumshow-946535872">RenRen</a>. The posters received a total of 500,000 views with more than 50,000 views for each poster.</p>
<p>Guokr.com also invited us to re-post our posters on <a href="https://www.guokr.com/post/543545/">their site</a> and posted them on weibo, where the posters received more than 6,000 re-post and 1,000 likes.</p>
<p>The followings are the animating posters that I designed.</p>
